# Annotating Hate Speech in \#china Tweets

## Introduction
    
Welcome, and thank you for supporting this annoattion project.

You're asked to read a given set of¬†tweets in¬†English, each one hashtagged \#china, i.e. with china-related issues as the main topic. For each tweet, we ask you to determine whether Hate Speech is present (label 1) or not (label 0).

> Hate Speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation nationality, religion, or other characteristics ([Basile et al., SemEval 2019](https://aclanthology.org/S19-2007/)).

More specifically,¬†according to [Basile et al., SemEval 2019](https://aclanthology.org/S19-2007/) HS may include:

- dehumanization or association with animals or entities considered inferior

- references to certain backgrounds/ethnicities as a threat to the national security or welfare or as competitors in the distribution of government resources

- delegitimation of social position or credibility based on origin/ethnicity¬†

- insults, threats, denigrating or hateful expressions 

- incitement to hatred, violence or violation of rights to individuals or groups perceived as different for somatic traits (e.g. skin color), origin, cultural traits, language, etc.

- presumed association of origin/ethnicity with cognitive abilities, propensity to crime, laziness or other vices

- references to the alleged inferiority (or superiority) of some ethnic groups with respect to others


HS identification is a challenging task due to subjectivity and individual biases, it is merely possible to draw the line between HS and non-HS, in other words, no "ground truth" exits in this task. Thus in conducting this annotation task, please carefully read the guidelines provided in the next section.


Guidelines
   =

Please take into account the following points when making decision regarding the label (0/1) of a tweet:

1. with \#china being a complex concept, we primarily consider Hate Speech against any China-related aspects, such as the following

    - China the country
    - the Chinese population (domestic/abroad)
        - domestic population residing in China
        - Chinese immigrants to other countries
        - non-permanent Chinese residents to other countries (tourists/students/workers/expatriate etc.)
    - A specific Chinese person (non-political figure)/a group of Chinese persons 

2. Due to the way data was collected and filtered, __HS against non-China-related targets will be rare cases, and will be considered non-HS (label 0)__

3. a message that spreads, incites, promotes or justifies HATRED OR VIOLENCE TOWARDS THE TARGET, or a message that aims at dehumanizing, hurting or intimidating the target

4. feel free to run through the checklist above in the INTRODUCTION section to determine the label


Here a list of other aspects that should be labbeled 0 in our study:

- the rare cases of HS against a non-China-related target

- generic offensive language

- fake news or untrue information

- offense towards political figures

- blasphemy

- historical denial

- overt incitement to terrorism

- defamation
