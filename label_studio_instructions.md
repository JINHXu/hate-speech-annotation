## Instructions to work with Label Studio

### We use [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)'s GUI to ease the manual annotation process. 

__Please use the invitation link I sent via email to join the project named "\#china hate" hosted by me on Label Studio.__

### Quick start

> NOTE: For Label Studio 1.7.2 you have to to confirm the dependencies libpq-dev and python3-dev are installed. As an example, to install on a Debian-based distro:
> `sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev`

> DEBUG: turn off any VPN services in case the backend does not response properly.
 
1. `pip install label-studio`
2. `label-studio start`
3. Open the Label Studio UI at http://localhost:8080.
4. Sign up with an email address and password that you create.
5. Use the link I shared via email to join the _\#china hate_ annotation project.
